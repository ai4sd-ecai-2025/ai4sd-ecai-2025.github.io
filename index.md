title: AI for Security and Defense
---

## Motivation

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a dual-use technology, where the same solutions are used for both civil security and defense. But this is more than just the application of known AI methods: Instead, security and defense are introducing new requirements, such as ethics and cybersecurity, for AI solutions. This workshop will discuss and present these new requirements and possible AI solutions for security and defense.

This includes the exploration of AI use cases in security and defense, the presentation of new approaches to security and defense challenges, as well as technical and non-technical challenges related to the use of AI in security and defense. Of particular importance is the techno-ethical dimension, which involves not only responsibility for the design and development of these AI systems/technologies, but also raises critical questions about the accountability of their use in contexts where AI supports or guides decision-making processes, especially where decisions have far-reaching societal or humanitarian consequences. Who is ultimately responsible and how can this responsibility be made transparent and enforceable?

## Topics of this Workshop

The AI4SD Workshop aims to bring together researchers from various fields to discuss the applications and conditions under which AI can be utilized in the security and defense domain. The workshop topics include, but are not limited to:

- Possible Applications, technical and nontechnical Challenges and Limitations of AI in:
    * Command & Control
    * Strategic and Operational Planning
    * Wargaming
    * Data Fusion
    * Situationanalysis
    * Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
    * ...
- Uncertainty in Security and Defense: Strategies for effectively managing the inherent uncertainty associated with data-driven AI methodologies in Security and Defense.
- Ethical Foundations of AI in Security and Defense: Exploring the core principles of AI ethics in dual-use technologies.
- Accountability and Responsibility in AI Systems: Developing frameworks for responsibility in AI-supported decision-making processes.
- Human Oversight and the Role of Ethics in Decision-Making: Examining human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, and humanstarting-the-loop paradigms for AI governance.

## Related Workshops

While there are dedicated workshops and conferences that address the technical aspects of AI in security and defense applications, as well as events focused on non-technical topics such as the ethical implications of AI, there is currently no platform that brings these two perspectives together. As a result, existing workshops remain niche events and AI in security and defense is not widely discussed by the broader AI community. Below is a list of related workshops and conferences:
