## Paper

For preparing your paper, we ask you to use the official AAAIâ€™24 author kit. If you intend to use some other word processing software, please make sure that the PDF file looks as much as our sample described in the above template.

We accept the following submission types:
- short paper (4 pages not including references / appendix)
- full paper (8 pages not including references / appendix)

Papers previously submitted to other journals / conferences are welcome. If the paper has already been rejected from a different conference a significant effort to address the criticisms should be made before submission. The review process will be single blind.

## Poster

You can use your preferred format for your posters, we kindly ask you to prepare posters no larger than A0 paper size.

## Publication

Proceedings of the workshop will be published on arXive.
