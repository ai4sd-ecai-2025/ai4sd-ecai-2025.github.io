## Submissions and Review Process

We invite researchers to submit original contributions in the form of full papers (up to 8 pages), following the [standard ECAI format](https://ecai2024.eu/download/ecai-template.zip). Papers previously submitted to other journals / conferences are also welcome. If the paper has already been rejected from a different conference a significant effort to address the criticisms should be made before submission. The review process will be single blind.

**Proceedings**: proceedings will be published in [OpenHSU](https://openhsu.ub.hsu-hh.de/home). An opportunity to publish in this series is given, provided that the work has not been published before. Original accepted papers will be submitted for indexation.

**Submission**: [Easychair_AI4SD](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ai4sd)
