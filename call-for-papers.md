## Workshop format

The workshop is planned as a one-day event. The primary focus will be on paper presentations. To kick off the day, there will be an invited talk by a distinguished speaker, setting the tone for the workshop. Additionally, a poster session will provide participants with an opportunity to present and discuss their ongoing work in an interactive setting. To conclude the workshop, we are considering hosting a panel discussion, fostering a lively exchange of ideas and perspectives.

## Attendance
We aim to facilitate discussions between researchers at all levels, including those who are just starting their careers and those who have extensive experience in the field. For this goal we allow the following participants:
- Accepted workshop paper
- Accepted poster
- Conference guests
- Participants of planning competition

## Submissons

We accept the following submission types:
- short paper (4 pages not including references / appendix)
- full paper (8 pages not including references / appendix)

Papers should be submitted in the AAAI format. Papers previously submitted to other journals or conferences are welcome. If a paper has already been rejected from a different conference a significant effort to address the criticisms should be made before submission. The review process will be single blind.

Papers can be submitted here.
