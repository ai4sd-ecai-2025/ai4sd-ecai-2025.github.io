## Organizing Committee

**Oliver Niggemann** did his doctorate in 2001 at the University of Paderborn with the topic Visual Data Mining of Graph-Based Data. He then worked for 8 years in leading positions in industry. From 2008-2019 he had a professorship at the Institute for Industrial Information Technologies (inIT) in Lemgo/Germany. Until 2019 he was also deputy head of the Fraunhofer IOSB-INA which works in industrial automation. On April 1, 2019, he took over the university professorship Computer Science in Mechanical Engineering at the Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg / Germany. There he does research at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence HSU-AI in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning for cyber-physical systems.

He organized the following conferences and workshops:
- ML4CPS Conference 2024, 2023, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017
- Associate Editor, IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering CASE 2020, 2019, 2018
- Program Committee and Organizer, International Workshop on the Principles of Diagnosis 2024-2015
- AAAI24 Workshop CAIPI - AI-based Planning for CyberPhysical Systems
- Special Session on “Diagnosis and Automated Repair” at IEEE International Conference on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems at ICPS 2022

**Gerhard Schreiber** is a professor of Social and Technology Ethics at the Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg / Germany. His research focuses on foundational and contemporary issues in applied ethics, the ethics of digitalization, and AI technologies, particularly generative AI and human-machine interaction, as well as anthropology within interdisciplinary scientific discourse. He has led and participated in several project groups at the Hessian Center for Responsible Digitalization (ZEVEDI) and currently serves as the spokesperson of The Trustworthy AI Lab and head of the AI Ethics Research Hub at Helmut Schmidt University. In collaboration with the HSUAI Institute, he examines the application of AI in cyber-physical systems from a techno-ethical perspective. He organized the following conferences and workshops:
- AI – Text and Validity (Centre of Responsible Digitality, Darmstadt) 2023
- Responsible Algorithmic Decision-Making (TU Darmstadt) 2023
- The Integration of AI-Based Gamification Elements into Military Training Contexts (HSU, Hamburg) 2024

**Wolfgang Koch** work comprises all aspects of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance ISR, Electronic / Navigation Warfare, resources management, and Manned-Unmanned Teaming. Being the Chief Scientist of Fraunhofer FKIE, he coordinates on a broader scale R&D activities related to digitalization in the defense and security domain. For the national FCAS technology development, he coordinates all defense-related Fraunhofer Institutes. He is particularly interested in ethical, social, and legal aspects of digitization, which he investiga[]tes as co-chair of the working group Technology Responsibility for FCAS. At the international level, he is active in the International Information Fusion Society ISIF, the IEEE Aerospace and Electronics Systems Society AESS, and the NATO Science and Technology Organization STO. Wolfgang Koch earned his PhD in theoretical physics at the RWTH Aachen and his habilitation degree in computer science at the University of Bonn. There he teaches on signal processing, sensor data fusion, artificial intelligence, and technical autonomy. In these fields he has published a monograph, edited several handbooks, and wrote numerous technical articles.
- IEEE Symposium, Sensor Data Fusion – Trends, Solution, Applications, 2024-2022
- NATO STO, Research Specialists Meetings SET-312 and SET-262

**René Heesch** is a PhD candidate at Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg, Germany. His research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence in technical systems, with a particular emphasis on defense-related contexts. Specifically, he explores methods to integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic AI approaches, aiming to mitigate the limitations of each. He was involved in organizing the following workshops:
- AAAI24 Workshop CAIPI - AI-based Planning for CyberPhysical Systems, 2024
- Program Committee, 3rd International Workshop on HYbrid Models for Coupling Deductive and Inductive ReAsoning (HYDRA) , 2024

**Björn Ludwig** is a PhD candidate at Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg, Germany. His research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in Cyber-Physical systems, with a particular emphasis on defense-related contexts. He explores methods for anomaly detection and knowledge integration with the aim of enhancing the resilience of technical systems.
